# FiatpandaRoofLights
I am building controlable lights on my fiat panda roof. I use a small mqtt script on some esp8266 01s with relay modules.

[ TO DO LIST ]
- set up Raspberry PI be mqtt broker
- set up Raspberry PI to host php enabled webpage
- create (webpage) control for the lights and their functions
- add more functions
- make it shoot lazerbeams
- add voice control
- blow the world away with awesomeness from this little Fiat Panda

[ CURRENT STRUGGLES ]
- none

[ LATER CAR PROJECTS ]
- automatic lights
- led strip side indicators/deco ligts when door opened



[ NEW IDEAS ]
