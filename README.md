# FiatpandaRoofLights
I am building controlable lights on my fiat panda roof. I use a small mqtt script on some esp8266 01s with relay modules.

TO DO LIST
- build more functions
- set up rpi0 with touchdisplay somewhere in the car. my initial thought is the drivers sunvisor.
- create simple webpage control for the lights and their functions

LATER PROJECTS
- automatic lights
- led strip side indicators/deco ligts when door opened
