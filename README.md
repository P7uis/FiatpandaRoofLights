# FiatpandaRoofLights
I am building controlable lights on my fiat panda roof. I use a small mqtt script on some esp8266 01s with relay modules.

[ TO DO LIST ]
- Find someone to help think and program
- set up rpi0 with touchdisplay or old android phone somewhere in the car. my initial thought is to build it in the the drivers sunvisor.
- create (webpage) control for the lights and their functions
- add more functions

[ LATER PROJECTS ]
- automatic lights
- led strip side indicators/deco ligts when door opened

[ IDEAS ]
- control options
  I would like to have web control so I can use a smartphone or RPI
  - full bash webpage
  - php enabled webpage that executes bash scripts
  - java with webpage buttons
  - arduino/esp hosting webpage
  - arduino with rotary encoder (no further webcontrol)
